Title : Predictive Model to Define the Next Step After Wafer Testing

Background : 
Functional testing is a crucial part of semiconductor manufacturing. It involves subjecting the ICs to various electrical tests to ensure they meet the required specifications. Currently, we, the product engineers have to verify parameter results and determine whether the lot is safe to deliver or require to run for more assessment. This process is very time consuming and require a lot of effort as we are handling huge amount of production lots. Hence, we would like to develop an efficient system where it can analyze functional parameters and define the next step.

Objective : To build a predictive model to define the next step after wafer testing.
